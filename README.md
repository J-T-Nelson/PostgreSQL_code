# PostgreSQL Portfolio

This PostgreSQL_code repo posseses SQL exercises and code I have worked on in the past. The purpose is to give insight into my level of experience with PostgreSQL and SQL generally. 

Below I will list by title the different sources of SQL code with breif explanations to give context on the code contained and its greater purpose to me. 

## [Kiwidamian SQL_practice]([url](https://github.com/kiwidamien/SQL_practice)https://github.com/kiwidamien/SQL_practice)

The repository linked in the title consists of 8 question sets, each of which uses different databases in order to create instructive challenge questions. Kiwidamian generously shared these with the community as a means to practice PostgreSQL for new developers. I found the questions while searching for resources to aid in learning PostgreSQL and decided it was a convinient starting point to practice writing queries of variable difficulty before incorporting SQL into any personal projects.   

This ["kiwidamian_practice_questions" folder]([url](https://github.com/J-T-Nelson/PostgreSQL_code/tree/master/kiwidamin_practice_questions)https://github.com/J-T-Nelson/PostgreSQL_code/tree/master/kiwidamin_practice_questions) contains two sub-directories, "[clean_SQL]([url](https://github.com/J-T-Nelson/PostgreSQL_code/tree/master/kiwidamin_practice_questions/clean_SQL)https://github.com/J-T-Nelson/PostgreSQL_code/tree/master/kiwidamin_practice_questions/clean_SQL)" and "[dirty_SQL]([url](https://github.com/J-T-Nelson/PostgreSQL_code/tree/master/kiwidamin_practice_questions/dirty_SQL)https://github.com/J-T-Nelson/PostgreSQL_code/tree/master/kiwidamin_practice_questions/dirty_SQL)". Clean_SQL contains questions next to final answers with a few comments as needed. Dirty_SQL contains the SQL files as they were spontaneously formed with no editing down. This means there is some experimentation to familiarize myself with query features and syntax, as well as some notes along side the code which I used to help work through the problems as I worked.
